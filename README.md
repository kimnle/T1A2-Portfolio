## Description of portoflio website

### Purpose

The portfolio website serves as a window into my skills and experience as a full-stack web developer and IT professional. It showcases my capabilities through informative sections about myself, my skill set, and my interests. Additonally, it highlights my past projects in a dedicated portfolio secition.

### Functionality/features

This single-page website utilises a sticky navigation bar, allowing visitors to jump between sections ("Home", "About", "Portfolio", "Blog", and "Contact") without returning to the top each time. Smooth scrolling further enhances user experience, mimicking natural scrolling when clicking navigation links.

The header, featuring the logo, remains fixed at the top, ensuring clear branding and easy viewing of the content, regardless of the user's scroll position.

Employing a mobile-first approach with multiple breakpoints, the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, guaranteeing optimal viewing experience on any device.

Built with accessibility as its core, the website utilises semantic elements for intuitive layout comprehension. All images are accompanied by descriptive alt test for users relying on screen readers. The design prioritised clarity with a simple layout, distinct background colours for each section, and prominent headings. Light backgrounds paired with black text ensure optimal contrast and readability.

### Screenshots

#### Wireframes

**Mobile**

Following a mobile-first approach, I initially created the wireframes in Figma. This ensured a strong foundation for a user-friendly experience across all devices.

**Tablet**

For wider tablet and desktop displays, I implemented Flexbox to achieve a side-by-side layout for the subheadings and their corresponding text within the about section. This approach was also applied to the blog section, ensuring articles are displayed consistently, as reflected in the wireframes and website screenshots below.

**Desktop**

As evident from the wireframes and website screenshots at various screen sizes, a focus on consistency was prioritised throughout the design process. Key components like the header, header logo, navigation, and footer were designed to remain consistent. Similarly, the home, portfolio, and contact sections maintain a similar layout, with the potential for the portfolio section to evolve as more projects are added, but will maintain the overall design language. The projects and posts pages also follow this consistent design approach.
