## Description of portoflio website

### Purpose

The portfolio website serves as a window into my skills and experience as a full-stack web developer and IT professional. It showcases my capabilities through informative sections about myself, my skill set, and my interests. Additonally, it highlights my past projects in a dedicated portfolio secition.

### Functionality/features

As the home, about, portfolio, blog and contact sections are on one page, the navigation is sticky so that visitors of the site can navigate to different sections of the page without scrolling to the top of the page every time.
